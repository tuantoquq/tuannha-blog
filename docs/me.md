# 👋 Hi, I'm Tuan

I’m a software engineer who loves building reliable platforms and sharing lessons learned from the trenches of DevOps, backend systems, and modern architecture. When I’m not tuning Dockerfiles or chasing down latency spikes, you can find me experimenting with coffee beans and capturing cityscapes with my camera.
